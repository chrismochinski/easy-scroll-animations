###### _NOTE: This project is built to be accessible to everyone - including new developers ( I'm looking at you, Primers_ ðŸ˜ƒ ). _If anything is confusing or you'd like some clarity, I'd be happy to help - hit me up!_


## ðŸ‘‡ <ins>This repository contains the following files</ins> ðŸ‘‡
<br>
<font color="lightblue">

- **animations.css** </font>- THIS IS THE MEAT N' TATERS of Easy Scroll Animations. 

<font color="lightblue">

- **README.md** </font> - You're lookin' at it. 

<font color="lightblue">

- **sample.html** </font> - A simple sample HTML file with a few demos of the included animations. 

<font color="lightblue">

- **script.js** </font> - This file contains the guts of the animation functionality and some explanations in the notes. Once you get the hang of it, you'll be able to create your own!
    
<font color="lightblue">

- **style.css** </font> - The style sheet that applies to the sample page. Nothing here is particularly relevant to the animations. 

## ðŸ‘‡ <ins>HOW TO APPLY THE ANIMATIONS TO YOUR OWN PROJECT</ins> ðŸ‘‡

1. **Fork/Clone** this repo as needed
2. **copy script.js** into your own project and source it into the head of any HTML pages where you'd like to use it, or copy the contents into any JavaScript file that's already imported. If it's in the same directory as your HTML file, it'll look like this:
            
            <script src="script.js" defer></script>

3. **copy animations.css** into your own project and source it into the head of any HTML pages where you'd like to use it, or copy the contents into any css file that's already imported. if it's in the same directory as your HTML file, it'll look like this:

            <link rel="stylesheet" href="animations.css" />

## Each HTML element that you'd like to animate will require TWO classes:

- The **first class** is telling the browser about the ***TIMING*** of the animation. There are such classes as ```move``` , ```fast-move```, and ```delay-move```.

- The **second class** is telling the browser what ***STYLE*** of animations we're using, directionally or otherwise. There are such classes as ```from-top```, ```from-small```, or more complicated stuff like ```from-rotate-c-270-up-right```.

No need to mess around with these in any CSS file if you don't want to! They're already set up. However, feel free to take a look at things such as the delay duration. You can tweak all kinds of features! Reference the included sample.html file for a few examples, and change them around to get a feel for things!

##### _( I'll do my best to update this repo with more animations and features as I have time, and I'll update this README accordingly )_

## AS ALWAYS - don't hesitate to reach out to me if you have questions! Always happy to help if I can!
